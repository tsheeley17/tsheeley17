Hi, Iâ€™m @tsheeley17 ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Jr. full-stack developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, React, and Python. I'm passionate about building web applications that are both beautiful and functional, and I enjoy working with a variety of technologies to bring ideas to life.

In my repositories, you'll find examples of my work in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development with Python and SQL. I also have projects that showcase my expertise in React and its ecosystem.

I'm always looking to improve my skills and learn new things, and I'm excited to collaborate with other developers on interesting and challenging projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations.
